[//]: # "Intro"
<p align="center"><img width="550" alt="Logo of Flobro followed by the text: Add an on-top browser to your workspace and watch your favorite online videos while working, gaming or studying" src="https://flobro.app/assets/images/flobro-promo-github.png"></p>

Do you want to work or game and simultaneously view a video or a webpage?
Then you need **Flobro**! With Flobro you can add a browser window to your screen that floats on top, so you can work or game and watch at the same time.

Flobro is distraction free, so no browser interface bugging on top.
